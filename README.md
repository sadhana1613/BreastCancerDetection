# Breast Cancer Detection
This project presents an approach for diagnosing breast cancer based on a set of input variables that describe some characteristics of tumor images. The proposed approach builds a binary logistic model that classifies between malignant and benign cases. The approach is applied to the Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer (WDBC) dataset. Experimental results show that the regression model that is statistically significant includes only the area, texture, concavity and symmetry features of a tumor. In addition to the simplicity of the used model, the reduced set of features gives performance measures that outperform similar approaches. Accordingly, the presented approach can be used for feature selection and reduction of the breast cancer data to enhance model performance and interpretability. In this project, accuracies of three different machine learning algorithms, Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) have been investigated. Results have been generated using different appropriate parameters for each algorithm respectively. The primary objective of this study is to explore the application of ML algorithms in breast cancer classification, thus emphasizing the potential to revolutionize early diagnosis and treatment decision-making, ultimately contributing to improved patient outcomes.
